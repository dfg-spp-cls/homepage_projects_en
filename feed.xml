&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is the development of a novel distant-reading tool for the
quantitative analysis of the use of rhetorical devices. The developed methods will be applied
for a comparative stylometric analysis of three medieval genres: the Middle High German
adaptations of the trois matières. From the viewpoint of medieval studies, we aim for
identifying genre-specific stylistic differences between romances of antiquity, Arthurian
romances, and chanson de geste adaptations of the 12 th and 13 th century. Up to now,
quantifiable similarities and differences of these genres regarding their use of rhetorical
devices have not been analysed. Such an analysis would be valuable for the controversial
discussion about the medieval concepts of ‘genre’ and the genre-awareness of medieval
authors as well as for assessing the relevance of rhetorical devices taught in medieval
schools for the practice of vernacular authors. To this end, we intend to analyse whether
selection, use, and frequency of rhetorical devices depend on the scene type and whether
characteristic differences can be attributed to genres or just different authors or dates of
origin. Such a broad analysis requires computational methods for distant reading, which do
not yet exist for the detection of stylistic devices to a satisfactory degree, not to mention for
Middle High German texts. For this purpose, we seek to develop novel methods for
detecting rhetorical devices based on methods from the fields of anomaly detection as well
as active and life-long machine learning. In this context, we consider rhetorical devices as
‘anomalies’, as deviations from the quantitative norm established by the greater part of the
corpus, which can be detected using statistical methods (e.g., a chiasmus is an anomaly
amidst non-chiastic constructions). To reduce time-consuming manual annotation tasks to a
minimum, we propose to employ active learning techniques in a semi-supervised scenario
with the human in the loop: Based on an initially unsupervised process of detecting stylistic
anomalies, the system refines itself in an interactive process by actively asking the user for
annotations for a few informative examples. Furthermore, we intend to integrate prior
theoretical knowledge provided by experts into the anomaly detection procedure for
filtering out obvious false positives and steering it towards certain rhetorical devices. In this
project, we will focus on two exemplary stylistic devices: the chiasmus as a figure of
repetition and the metaphor as a trope. The latter can be seen as an anomaly as well due to
the unusual interactions between words from different domains, reflected in their word
embeddings. Since such embeddings need to be learned from huge corpora, which are not
available for low-resource languages such as Middle High German, we also strive for
developing a technique to adapt such embeddings learned on New High German corpora to
Middle High German.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Steffen Pielström</name></author><summary type="html">Joachim Denzler &amp; Sophie Marshall</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">The beginnings of modern poetry - Modeling literary history with text similarities</title><link href="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-Beginnings_of_Poetry/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The beginnings of modern poetry - Modeling literary history with text similarities" /><published>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-Beginnings_of_Poetry</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-Beginnings_of_Poetry/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simone Winko &amp;amp; Fotis Jannidis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition of realism, the dominant art form of the 19th Century, to early modernism at the turn to the 20th Century has been seen by contemporaries then and literary history since then as a profound change affecting many formal and content-related aspects. This is also true for poetry. But while today only a small group of poets and poems is seen as ‘modern’, the contemporaries applied this attribute to much more texts as can be seen, for example, by looking at all the anthologies with modern poetry published around 1900. One of the main goals is to understand this discrepancy: Does literary history ignore the modern trends in those other poems or did the contemporaries perceive change and innovation where there was none? In order to answer this question we will look at the similarity of texts, assuming that more modern texts will be more similar with each other than with more traditional texts. Similarity is always related to a specific perspective. The dimensions under which contemporaries then and literary historians today see the main differences between the poetry of realism and early modernism are mostly the same: new themes, new forms and a new way of addressing and expressing emotions in poems. We will cover all these aspects but with different degrees of effort to innovate the methods used. The development of new methods will concentrate on semantic text similarity and sentiment or more exact emotion analysis. Measuring the text similarity of short texts like poems is quite challenging, but since the introduction of word2vec and other forms of word embeddings the situation has improved dramatically. Applying these approaches to historical texts and especially to a genre like poetry is another challenge: The vocabulary of poetry is markedly different even compared to that of other literary genres. It is characterized by the usage of old-fashioned words and neologisms, many of which are compound words. Determining which approach to word embeddings is preferable for our use cases and how they can be used to represent short texts focusing on dimensions like general semantics is one focus. The other is the development of an historical sentiment lexicon including emotions without anachronism. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Steffen Pielström</name></author><summary type="html">Simone Winko &amp; Fotis Jannidis</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">CHYLSA (Children’s and Youth Literature Sentiment Analysis)*</title><link href="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-CHYLSA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CHYLSA (Children’s and Youth Literature Sentiment Analysis)*" /><published>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-CHYLSA</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-CHYLSA/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berenike Herrmann, Arthur Jacobs, Moniek Kuijpers, Gerhard Lauer &amp;amp; Jana Lüdtke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotional involvement is of pivotal importance when children learn to read, tell, and share stories. This crucial dimension of cultural literacy has received surprisingly little attention within literary studies, psychology, and digital humanities. Taking a large-scale and data-driven approach, the most promising method to assess emotional information in children’s reading material is sentiment analysis. It allows the analysis of larger text corpora to find verbal emotional patterns potentially guiding young readers’ affective-aesthetic responses to literary texts – to characters, events, narrator/voice, and poem lines. Consequently, it facilitates modeling the role of emotions in the interaction of emerging literary literacy and social-cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, standard sentiment analysis tools were developed in the (industry-driven) framework of opinion mining and need domain-adaptation to literary discourse. Also, disconnected from psychological THEORIES, they often encode models of affect, emotion, and mood that are psychologically questionable, and lack empirical cross-validation. In (digital) literary studies, only a very small number of studies applies sentiment analysis to children’s literature. Most importantly, standard sentiment analysis outside the scope of children’s literature does not assess aesthetic and indirectly communicated feelings. Consequently, its application to literary texts in general and particularly to children’s literature has conceptual and methodological limitations, specifically for historical, non-English, and highly AESTHETIC texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose to advance sentiment analysis of literary texts for young readers in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) by building a representative and balanced corpus of children’s literature from different literary epochs and across a variety of genres,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) by using this corpus for a domain adaptation of sentiment analysis for literary texts that is also pioneering within NLP for its psychologically approved modeling of AFFECTS and aesthetic feelings, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) by testing the validity of these tools via predicting and assessing children’s reading experience and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research is motivated by the theoretical frameworks of social-interactive theory of narrative learning, the Neurocognitive Poetics Model of literary reading (https://www.researchgate.net/project/Neurocognitive-Poetics), and a systematic and historical philological account of situated emotion-cognition in children’s literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAUTION project aims to strengthen interconnections across subfields of literary studies, (computational) linguistics and digital humanities (DH), addressing the aesthetic phenomenon of unreliable narration. Arthur Schnitzler’s novella ‘Andreas Thameyers letzter Brief’ (1902) is a typical example. The narrator tries to convince his addressees that his wife has been faithful, but to a commonsensical reader the ‘evidence’ he provides tells quite a different story. She gave birth to a dark-skinned baby nine months after being alone with foreigners from an exotic country.&lt;br /&gt;
The phenomenon presents challenges to approaches of text description/interpretation that emphasize text-based operationalization of concepts. The research literature abounds with discussions of interpretive implications for concrete examples of unreliable narration – but can text-independent guidelines be devised that lead to an intersubjectively stable assessment of plausible readings by trained literary scholars?&lt;br /&gt;
In this respect, unreliable narration is paradigmatic for phenomena whose key characteristics can only be captured at a ‘depth’ of analysis exceeding the level of literal semantic interpretation. Documenting the processes of (re)constructing non-literal meanings is notoriously difficult as it involves long inference chains and implicit or background knowledge. Most DH work on literary texts has so far addressed aspects associated with surface properties (e.g. style, topic structure, or networks of textually evident cross-character relations): Recent Natural Language Processing methods require large amounts of data, which are easier to obtain for surface-level phenomena. Moreover, annotated datasets for systematic narratological analysis are only beginning to become available. Hence it is currently hard to assess whether the generalizing potential, e.g., in neural modeling architectures, could capture aspects of the process of assigning non- literal meanings to texts: Theoretically grounded reference data for testing are missing.&lt;br /&gt;
Unreliable narration is an apt case for experimenting with the annotation of derived meanings and thus filling the gap. Attributing unreliability to a narrator involves inferences beyond plain linguistic interpretation – However, since the focus is on concrete questions about what happens in the fictional world of the narrative (i.e. content-specifying questions as opposed to content-transcending ones), the phenomenon of unreliability offers good starting points for research into literary principles of interpretation. If different readers of the same text suspect unreliability, then their inference chains will have a similar logical structure.&lt;br /&gt;
In CAUTION we work with a basic corpus of eight German-language short stories from the 19th to the 21st century, which are extensively collaboratively annotated, and an expanded corpus of approximately 30 additional German-language short stories and novels, which are explored using various text-mining techniques, and partially annotated.
Our collaborative text annotation will target this parallelism in reasoning about the narrator: where the annotators categorize textual indicators of unreliable narration, identify and document relevant assumptions. We formalize interpretive strategies a reader can adopt using a multi-agent belief revision system from AI. Working on a corpus of systematically chosen texts, we will work cyclically towards a catalogue of formalizations for annotators to choose from to capture their reading of a text. Since inference chains for non-trivial stories are complicated, it is only through computational inference engines that the alternative formulations can be checked and improved – aiming to suitably capture patterns in the entire corpus.&lt;br /&gt;
In a complementary approach intertwined with collaborative annotation, we use existing text-mining techniques, annotation results, and relevant research literature on unreliable narratives to develop a heuristic for identifying textual indicators of unreliable narration, which allows the exploration of larger corpora with respect to unreliability and related phenomena from the field of truth in fiction.
Accordingly, CAUTION’s objective is not only to approach the phenomenon of unreliable narration in a mixed-method approach, but also to address it on a more general level in two ways: From a literary-theoretical and methodological point of view, the project is concerned with the investigation of the principles of (content-specific) interpretation; for the field of Computational Literary Studies, the project is also to be understood as a test case of computer-aided research into interpretation-dependent text phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Steffen Pielström</name></author><summary type="html">Jonas Kuhn &amp; Janina Jacke</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Comparative Annotation to Explore and Explain Text Similarities (CompAnno)</title><link href="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-CompAnno/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Comparative Annotation to Explore and Explain Text Similarities (CompAnno)" /><published>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-CompAnno</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-CompAnno/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julia Nantke &amp;amp; Nils Reiter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project CompAnno develops a comparative annotation framework for the exploration
and explanation of text similarities regarding the representation of character properties. We
focus our approach of comparative annotation on the category of literary character, because
it is central to the composition of literary texts in general as well as for establishing,
describing and interpreting intertextual relations. In contrast to existing and frequently used
annotation approaches, comparative annotation rests on the simultaneous observation and
comparison of multiple text snippets. Character properties are initially assigned manually in
comparison of the snippets. Collecting annotations for a large number of pairs allows to
establish a ranking of similarity, which in turn will be used to train a machine learning
system. The comparative annotation process results in a partial ordering for each property.
The main benefit of this approach is that besides supporting intertextual annotation it
generally allows the annotation of abstract, interpretation-related textual features like the
description and characterization of literary characters.
We employ various technical methods that offer different perspectives on the task at hand.
Basically, three perspectives can be differentiated: 1. If cast as a document retrieval task, a
technical system can provide a user with snippets that are similar to the one they are
investigating. This reveals (potentially new) intertextual relations, but requires an efficiently
computable similarity function, which is constructed from assignments of property values to
individual snippets. 2. If the problem is cast as a ranking task, a system can provide a
ranking of provided snippets according to some property’s value. This has many other
benefits and use-cases, besides comparison, as it provides access to (some aspects of)
characterization in general. 3. If similarity itself is taken into focus, a ranking system can be
applied to pairs of snippets, and provide, over a set of snippets, a ranking of all the pairs of
snippets according to their similarity. In this case, similarity is also caused by the absence or
small value of a property (e.g., two snippets can be similar because the characters are not
malicious). In all cases, we support the re-integration of these quantitative results into literary
studies discourse by providing guiding information for their interpretation.
The project thus aims at two concrete outcomes: On the one hand, we develop the first
framework for computer-based investigation of intertextuality and text similarity, that goes
beyond text re-use and does not assume a fixed corpus. On the other hand, we provide a
new way of working with interpretative categories, which are common in computational
literary studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Steffen Pielström</name></author><summary type="html">Julia Nantke &amp; Nils Reiter</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Computational Approaches to Narrative Space in 19th and 20th Century Novels (CANSpiN)</title><link href="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-Computational_Approaches_to_Narrative_Space/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Computational Approaches to Narrative Space in 19th and 20th Century Novels (CANSpiN)" /><published>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-Computational_Approaches_to_Narrative_Space</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-Computational_Approaches_to_Narrative_Space/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ulrike Henny-Krahmer, Roger Labahn &amp;amp; Holger Helbig&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literary theory provides elaborate instruments for the conceptualization and description of narrative space, understood here as the concrete space of the narrated world, in which characters live, act, and move. However, to be able to use the existing concepts in computational analyses, they need to be formalized and mapped to features that can be captured on the linguistic surface of the texts. For distant reading approaches, in particular, it is necessary to design algorithms that allow to annotate the features automatically. In this area, so far, only basic preliminary work has been done for the computational, quantitative analysis of narrative space.
In order to provide a solid basis for further computational research, we aim to develop methods for the recognition of spatial entities, i.e. all kinds of references to narrative space in the literary texts, such as toponyms, general space-related nouns or deictic expressions. For this task, we use existing semantic word nets and machine learning techniques, in particular neural large-scale language models, which are able to consider the linguistic context of the relevant spatial references. On top of the basic recognition of the spatial entities, methods are developed to classify them further into higher level categories such as mentions of space that are directly relevant to the plot vs. descriptions of the setting vs. further references to spatial entities. A third aim of the project is to approach the semantic structure of narrative worlds and the symbolic meaning of subspaces by connecting occurrences of spatial references in the texts with topics and sentiments.
The research is based on empirical work, using corpora of novels in Spanish and German from the 19th and 20th century, which were chosen to develop multilingual and/or language-independent solutions. Gold standard reference data are created by manually annotating parts of the corpora, which are then used for the evaluation of the methods. From a literary historical perspective, we examine how the representation of space in the novels connects to questions of national, regional and other kinds of identity related to space, following the concept of “imagined communities” (Anderson). This is done by linking the analysis of spatial references in the texts to author nationalities, publication places of the novels, and topics of the texts. With the corpus-based studies, existing literary historical questions such as the role of novels in the process of nation-building in the 19th century and their function in the formation of two German identities in 20th century post-war literature are addressed, with a new set of computational methods and on a broader empirical basis than before, in order to substantiate and extend previous research results.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the depiction and evocation of emotions are at the heart of dramatic production and poetological reflection since Aristotle quantitative drama analysis has neglected them so far. This is why the project aims at extracting emotions of characters and analyzing their appraisal with sentiment analysis. As emotions are highly depended on cultural and historical circumstances we chose to look at the historical phase starting from the  end of Thirty Years’ War up to restoration period in the 19th century during which German drama was established. This is a story of developing various subgenres which vary with respect to their thematization and presentation of emotions, mostly termed ‘Affekte’ in that period. The project relies on a corpus of German drama which is significantly enlarged compared to the available one for that period, the Textgrid corpus. It now comprises another 25 libretti of the Hamburger Gänsemarktoper from the period between 1678 and 1730, another 20 libretti from around 1800 as well as 20 texts from the strolling players. This enables us to research the most important dramatic (sub-)genre for the development of affect expression, the libretti of musical theatre, in its influences on spoken theatre.
In a first step models for the analysis of emotion in dramatic texts shall be evaluated with regard to their use for digital analysis. Retrievable linguistic as well as rhetorical means are specified and extracted for whole texts as well as for elements of dramatic texts specifically dedicated to the depiction of affects: stage directions, soliloquies, arias and endings of drama. Human annotators will specify for genre-specific subcorpora which emotions are mentioned (for example happiness, love, sorrow, envy). They will also annotate if these emotions are evaluated positively or negatively. In a next step algorithms of sentiment analysis shall be trained on this material. It is an important goal of the project to approve the method of sentiment analysis for its use on historical, especially fictional, corpora.
Having done all this work we should be able to identify pathos-strategies, id est passages of texts with a high arousal of emotions and to give first hints as to which emotions are thematized with which appraisal. Another objective is the revision of the history of the comic character and its relation to the emotion of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the project EmoDrama I, we advanced the research areas of CLS, NLP and German literary studies by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending preexisting corpora for plays of the time frame 1650-1815 with non-canonical works in machine readable TEI format,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operationalizing the variety of historical emotion terms, emotion concepts and aspects of emotion presentation for a drama-historical question,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;defining 13 historical emotion concepts in a historically adequate way, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing comprehensive annotation guidelines with numerous complex examples from drama texts on the individual emotion concepts, on source and target, on negation and on the distinction between expressed, attributed and pretended emotion, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annotating 17 plays that can be used for analysis and machine learning,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;analyzing the annotations of plays and reflect upon the usage of quantitative annotation analysis for literary studies,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evaluating multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods for single-label emotion classification (Schmidt, Dennerlein, Wolff 2021b)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;training models optimized for our specific task (Schmidt, Dennerlein, Wolff 2021b, Dennerlein, Schmidt, Wolff 2023)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exploring the classified data with regard to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the correlation of emotions and plot developments (Dennerlein, Schmidt, Wolff 2022a; Dennerlein, Schmidt, Wolff 2022b)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the distinciton of tragedy endings from comedy endings on the basis of their emotional footprint (Dennerlein, Schmidt, Wolff 2023)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the frequency distributions of emotions in the overall corpus and the major genres comedy and tragedy: anger shows up to be one of the most prominent emotions in comedies (Dennerlein, Schmidt, Wolff
      2023)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Emotions which are already discussed more frequently in stage directions from 1730 onwards, and not only since 1770 (Dennerlein, Schmidt, Wolff in print).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed project ‘Evaluating Events in Narrative Theory’ (EvENT) is an interdisciplinary approach to the formalization and analysis of events in narratives, based on a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and concepts of Literary Studies. With a focus on the potential added value of using concepts of one discipline in the other one, the project includes the theoretical research of event concepts in both disciplines, the subsequent modeling and implementation for the automatic analysis of narrative texts, and the application of these systems for literary text analysis as well as in the context of information representation.
For the NLP research community, the theoretical discussions on narrative research questions and the operationalization of respective concepts in cooperation with Literary Studies will lead to advances on modeling events, sequences of events and a notion of event centrality/event ranking within long documents, with the additional challenge from the application domain, i.e. German literary texts.
For Narratology the modeling of events in cooperation with NLP will establish a testbed, which has not been available so far. Inductive development and application of categories for text analysis as performed in Literary Studies is complemented by a deductive approach, evaluating these categories on a variety of texts. This will lead to a twofold advancement of Narratology: with regard to theory the iterative modeling will generate theoretical findings about the formal narrative concept of events, with regard to the application of event concepts tools will be developed that can be applied for the computer-aided analysis of literary texts.
The automation of the analysis of events and event patterns in literary texts will address three areas, which align with the central role of events in narratology: (1) the formal description of events as well as narratological models of narrative constitution based on them, (2) the analysis of event- fulness, which will be based on the event II concept and the results of the first item, and (3) the operationalization of both for the automatic analysis and classification of narratives as well as the analysis of further narratological phenomena with respect to the specificity of related event types or patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Steffen Pielström</name></author><summary type="html">Evelyn Gius &amp; Chris Biemann</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Quantitative Drama Analytics: Tracking Character Knowledge (Q:TRACK)</title><link href="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-QTrack/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quantitative Drama Analytics: Tracking Character Knowledge (Q:TRACK)" /><published>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-QTrack</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/projects_en/2020/01/24/TP-QTrack/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nils Reiter &amp;amp; Marcus Willand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q:TRACK’s research programme interlinks objectives in two research areas: literary and drama history and computational literary studies. In the first area, we are aiming at new insights about the way social knowledge is used to drive or solve the dramatic conflict in plays. We initially focus on the distribution and dissemination of knowledge within the single dramatic world of a play. An outcome of our work programme will be a formal model of the knowledge that each character as well as the audience has and gains within each segment (act, scene, appearance). Such a model, once it has been established, allows to visualize relations as well as drawing inferences. This can support close reading, but also facilitates comparing plays in a systematic way. Once such models can be created automatically, we will “zoom out” and look at dissemination patterns from a drama historical point of view, asking how they change over the centuries. A dissemination pattern is a generalization of the model found within a set of plays that is achieved by disregarding character names and allowing for some variation in the details. One such pattern might be that the relation triggering the anagnorisis is transmitted via a character not involved in the actual relation (as heralds, servants etc.).
In order to pursue our literary and drama historic goals, we thus systematically reconstruct constellations, modes and techniques of dramatic knowledge distribution. As an outcome of this project, we will gain insights into the blueprints of the art of playwriting. By taking a multi-perspectival viewpoint on character and audience knowledge we not only assure ourselves of a non-interpretive access to the plays. We also provide an intersubjective, meta-historical approach to the identification of text elements that supposedly function as sympathy and empathy control of readers and trigger dramatic effects as the purgation of emotions (catharsis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a mixed methods approach to literary history, we intend to use network models of text relations to study how groupings emerge relative to the way text corpora have been compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational analysis of big data is as much about analysis as it is about the data itself. Corpora are almost never representative samples but opportunistic if not deliberate collections. Their composition is thus subject to systematic biases and affects the analysis of relations among texts, positions and status of texts relative to others, and the categorization of texts into groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will develop network models that integrate stylometric, semantic, and annotation data specifically for German-speaking and European Anglophone literatures of the 18th and 19th century, concentrating on novels and narratives. Our goal is to shine a different light on the establishment of genre conventions, subgenres and epoch style within this decisive period. From a socio-historical view point we focus on those texts and authors who were marginalized in the course of literary history, paying special attention to female writers and their positions alongside canonized texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing models and algorithms, we will use corpus manipulation as a heuristic method to study grouping processes and combined synchronic and diachronic corpus comparison. By detecting groups on a certain data level and watch them disappear on another, we will be able to foster our understanding of both historical and systematic text relations, and also of text groups within different periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dr. Steffen Pielström</name></author><summary type="html">Ulrik Brandes &amp; Thomas Weitin</summary></entry></feed>
